# Summary of Opration Modes
The following is a summary of the operation mode from an electromechanical / functional pov. So the terminology is likely, medically incorrect. 

## Pressure Control
As the name suggest, in this mode, the device delivers a set pressure profile

Units: 

## Volume Control
In this mode, the device delivers a set volumetric flow rate

## Patient Assist
In some cases, the patient is able to initiate a breath sequence but only needs an assist, compared to a fully actuated breath sequence. 


## Terminologiy Simplified

#### PEEP: Post End-Respiratory Pressure
The presssure, in the lungs, at the end of a breath cycle

#### TV: Tidal Volume $V_T$
Represents the normal volume displaced. It's the the volume move in and out during quiet breathing. 

#### TLC: Total Lung Capacity [mL/inspiration] or [mL/kg of body mass]
Well, the volume of the lungs at max inflation
Approx: 500 [mL/inspiration] or 7[mL/kg]


#### Rate [/min]
Breath cycles per minute (10-15)

#### $FiO_2$ Concentration of oxygen [percentage]
The percentage of oxygen in the mix. In air it's normally 21% (0.21), but can be set higher in a ventilator. 

#### $T_{insp}$ Inspiratory Time [sec]

#### I:E Ratio 
Ratio of Inspiratory time: expiratory time. Can be 1:1 or 1:2, 1:3, 1:4 . Used to support Asthmatics

An inverse ratio (2:1) or higher, is typically used to support *non-compliant* lungs

## MV Target: Respiratory Minute Volume [L/min]
Volume of gas inhaled or exhaled from lung, per minute.
