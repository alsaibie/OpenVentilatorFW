## Control System 
### Input requirements 
Control Interface
1. Knob to control volume
2. Knob to control frequency
3. Knob to control pressure?
4. Switch to flip modes

Sensor Interface:
1. Pressure sensor
2. Flow sensor?
3. 

### Output requirements

User Info
1. Operating Time
2. Pressure in line
3. Pressure graph or volume graph


Actuation
1. Stepper motor control
2. Emergency Buzzer
3. Emergency Shutoff


### Logic Function Requirements
A. Pressure Control Mode

B. Volume Control Mode

### Safety requirements
1. Sense deviation from set pressure / volume
2. Sense any sudden blockage in line
- This can be done via pressure sensing / flow sensing or through current sensing if using a proper stepper motor driver
4. Sense the CO2 is being pushed back or that correct amount is extracted?
5. Sense that flow in = flow out?
6. 
7. Sense that CO2 is
